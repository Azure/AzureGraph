Description: A simple interface to the 'Microsoft Graph' API <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview>. 'Graph' is a comprehensive framework for accessing data in various online Microsoft services. This package was originally intended to provide an R interface only to the 'Azure Active Directory' part, with a view to supporting interoperability of R and 'Azure': users, groups, registered apps and service principals. However it has since been expanded into a more general tool for interacting with Graph. Part of the 'AzureR' family of packages.
