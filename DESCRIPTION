Description: A simple interface to the 'Microsoft Graph' API <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview>. 'Graph' is a comprehensive framework for accessing data in various online Microsoft services. Currently, this package aims to provide an R interface only to the 'Azure Active Directory' part, with a view to supporting interoperability of R and 'Azure': users, groups, registered apps and service principals. However it can be easily extended to cover other services. Part of the 'AzureR' family of packages.
